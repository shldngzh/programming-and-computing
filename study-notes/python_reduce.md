# reduce() in Python

## XOR: exclusive or

p XOR q = (p V q) ^ ~(p ^ q)

## Python bitwise operator
* x << y returns x with bits shifted to left by y places
* x >> y returns x with bits shifted to right by y places
* x & y bitwise and, each bit of the output is 1 if the each bit of x AND y is 1
* x | y bitwise or, each bit of the ouput is 0 if the each bit of x AND y is 0
* ~x returns complement of x, switching each bit of x
* x ^ y bitwise XOR, each bit of the output is the XOR of the corresponding bit(s) of x and y (x and y shares same bit length)
